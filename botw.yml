      3 Weeks ago a researcher on the outer rim sent us this strange entry.
      
      Day 17 : Research entry 723
      
      I've been observing this small Floran tribe on the outer rim for sometime now. Strangely today I noticed the entire tribe all communed into one building. For hours all I could hear was what appeared to be some form of chanting, almost sounding like monks "om-ing"
      
      Extremely strange behaviour for Floran, something I have never witnessed in all my years of studying them. After they had left, I carefully entered what I assumed to be a place of worship, Only to discover a lone piece of corn
      
      Do the Floran see this as some form of ... god?
      
      \- End of transmission -
      
      No one has heard from him since. Was he right? Did he really find a small disconnected Floran tribe establishing a religion? We must investigate further.
      
      * Build a Floran ( Nature ) styled place of worship
    
      * must contain 1 corn plant or piece of corn, 1 altar of some form and seating for worshippers.

      *This week is more of a challenge than normal. If it goes over well with the community I may do more of these in future.* 
      
      
      As there seems to be a fair few new players and with a new expansion we can expect even more, I thought it would be fun to do some "starter" builds as a source of inspiration. 
      
      So this week the build criteria is to only use things that a new player on the starting world can use. For those not wishing to start a new character, I have created a list of blocks and objects available to a brand new player.
      
      https://pastebin.com/46jzpqyw
      
      It would be nice to keep the ore blocks to a minimal, as grabbing a surplus of metals early game is pretty difficult. 
      
      Farmables include: corn, cotton, wheat, pearl peas, potatoes and rice. 
      
      
      * Build a Starter home for a new player 
      * must contain at least 1 bedroom, storage, a crafting area, a place to eat and a farm.

      After the notorious Dreadwing incident, Government's across the universe met to discuss rising threats and the need to tackle them. With Dreadwing they got lucky, a member of the protectorate managed to intervene and handle the issue. But they all agreed they needed something more reliable and solid. 
      
      After many long debates, they finally settled on a solution to the problems of the universe. 
      
      And thus, C.U.T.E ( Critter Urban Tactical Enforcement ) was born.
      
      Each race would put forth its most renowned critter trainer, and together they would train the most elite and adorable law enforcement agency that has ever existed. 
      
      * Build a headquarters for C.U.T.E
      * must contain bedrooms for trainers, pens for critters, a jail for captured villains and a reception area for civilians to report crimes.

      C.U.T.E Case File 091283723 - Personal entry : Detective McSqueek
      
      I've been tracking a gang of notorious pick pockets, "U.G.L.Y" ( Unlawful Grabbing of Loot Yeild )
      
      They have been robbing everyone from Terramart employees to spaceship captains, and every time I even began to get close, they just slip away. 
      
      The chiefs really riding me on this one. I've lost so many nights sleep and my wife is even threatening to leave me with our 27 kids. 
      
      But there is a light at the end of the tunnel, an ex U.G.L.Y member has requested to see me. Apparently, he has some intel on who U.G.L.Y are and where they are operating from. I have a feeling they are far more organized than we could've ever have imagined.
      
      My hunch is, they are truly the opposite and rival of C.U.T.E. These are not just robberies. They are gearing up for something big...
      
      And my hunches are rarely wrong. 
      
       
      
       
      
      * Build a hiding base of operations for U.G.L.Y
      * must contain a treasure room, bedrooms, and a "Front" for the operation ( example they could be based underneath a shop )

      The Galatic summit fell into darkness as the lights turned off. A glowing white box appeared on the wall, flickering from an old projector. Professor Hugh Mungus stood sternly in front of the audience with a clicker in his hand. 
      
      **Click*
      
      *"This is the Amazon jungle."* The professor announced. 
      
      The Floran Ambassador's eyes almost jump out of his head
      
      *"It's gone."* 
      
      *"Floranss iss ssad"* Could be heard from the Ambassador's section. 
      
      **Click* 
      
      *"This is the The Great Barrier Reef"*
       
      The Hylotl Ambassador spat his green tea out in shock and awe
      
      *"It's gone."* 
      
      This continued for a further 20 minutes. All the marvelous place of Earth where shown, each followed by "it's gone". The air in the summit felt heavy with regret and sadness. 
      
      Finally, the professor gave his small speech. 
      
      "The Universe is ever changing. Threats come and go, planets are born and planets die. I come here today before all of you, to ask that we start a galaxy wide effort to document and store data on all of the natural beauty around us, before its too late"
      
      His speech was met with a standing roar of approval, and the huge effort to document all the natural wonders of the galaxy started immediately after. 
      
      * Build a natural wonder of the Galaxy.
      * must not be man-made, must not be a current location. ( Think outside the box, its an alien universe! Floating islands, poison waterfalls, Erichus volcanoes, theres no limit!)

      "it's an insult to everything Earth ever stood for" 
      
      "This has to be the worst thing I've ever seen, I feel sick just looking at it."
      
      "I am so offended it hurts"
      
      "Who ever made this should be shot"
      
      "I lost family on Earth, and this is how they are remembered?"
      
      "Fine. I'll be the one who finally says it. It looks like a massive &lt;Censored&gt;"
      
      
      The unveiling of the Earth Monument didn't exactly go as planned. As the curtain fell, it was met with a field of silence, followed by angry protests. It was a disaster would be an understatement. 
      
      Completely embarrassed, the Earth Remembrance committee have launched a campaign, asking citizens across the galaxy to come up with a new idea and fast! 
      
      
      * Build a Monument to Earth
      * must have a seating and picnic area for visitors
