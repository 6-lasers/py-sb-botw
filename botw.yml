      3 Weeks ago a researcher on the outer rim sent us this strange entry.
      
      Day 17 : Research entry 723
      
      I've been observing this small Floran tribe on the outer rim for sometime now. Strangely today I noticed the entire tribe all communed into one building. For hours all I could hear was what appeared to be some form of chanting, almost sounding like monks "om-ing"
      
      Extremely strange behaviour for Floran, something I have never witnessed in all my years of studying them. After they had left, I carefully entered what I assumed to be a place of worship, Only to discover a lone piece of corn
      
      Do the Floran see this as some form of ... god?
      
      \- End of transmission -
      
      No one has heard from him since. Was he right? Did he really find a small disconnected Floran tribe establishing a religion? We must investigate further.
      
      * Build a Floran ( Nature ) styled place of worship
    
      * must contain 1 corn plant or piece of corn, 1 altar of some form and seating for worshippers.

      *This week is more of a challenge than normal. If it goes over well with the community I may do more of these in future.* 
      
      
      As there seems to be a fair few new players and with a new expansion we can expect even more, I thought it would be fun to do some "starter" builds as a source of inspiration. 
      
      So this week the build criteria is to only use things that a new player on the starting world can use. For those not wishing to start a new character, I have created a list of blocks and objects available to a brand new player.
      
      https://pastebin.com/46jzpqyw
      
      It would be nice to keep the ore blocks to a minimal, as grabbing a surplus of metals early game is pretty difficult. 
      
      Farmables include: corn, cotton, wheat, pearl peas, potatoes and rice. 
      
      
      * Build a Starter home for a new player 
      * must contain at least 1 bedroom, storage, a crafting area, a place to eat and a farm.

      After the notorious Dreadwing incident, Government's across the universe met to discuss rising threats and the need to tackle them. With Dreadwing they got lucky, a member of the protectorate managed to intervene and handle the issue. But they all agreed they needed something more reliable and solid. 
      
      After many long debates, they finally settled on a solution to the problems of the universe. 
      
      And thus, C.U.T.E ( Critter Urban Tactical Enforcement ) was born.
      
      Each race would put forth its most renowned critter trainer, and together they would train the most elite and adorable law enforcement agency that has ever existed. 
      
      * Build a headquarters for C.U.T.E
      * must contain bedrooms for trainers, pens for critters, a jail for captured villains and a reception area for civilians to report crimes.

      C.U.T.E Case File 091283723 - Personal entry : Detective McSqueek
      
      I've been tracking a gang of notorious pick pockets, "U.G.L.Y" ( Unlawful Grabbing of Loot Yeild )
      
      They have been robbing everyone from Terramart employees to spaceship captains, and every time I even began to get close, they just slip away. 
      
      The chiefs really riding me on this one. I've lost so many nights sleep and my wife is even threatening to leave me with our 27 kids. 
      
      But there is a light at the end of the tunnel, an ex U.G.L.Y member has requested to see me. Apparently, he has some intel on who U.G.L.Y are and where they are operating from. I have a feeling they are far more organized than we could've ever have imagined.
      
      My hunch is, they are truly the opposite and rival of C.U.T.E. These are not just robberies. They are gearing up for something big...
      
      And my hunches are rarely wrong. 
      
       
      
       
      
      * Build a hiding base of operations for U.G.L.Y
      * must contain a treasure room, bedrooms, and a "Front" for the operation ( example they could be based underneath a shop )

      The Galatic summit fell into darkness as the lights turned off. A glowing white box appeared on the wall, flickering from an old projector. Professor Hugh Mungus stood sternly in front of the audience with a clicker in his hand. 
      
      **Click*
      
      *"This is the Amazon jungle."* The professor announced. 
      
      The Floran Ambassador's eyes almost jump out of his head
      
      *"It's gone."* 
      
      *"Floranss iss ssad"* Could be heard from the Ambassador's section. 
      
      **Click* 
      
      *"This is the The Great Barrier Reef"*
       
      The Hylotl Ambassador spat his green tea out in shock and awe
      
      *"It's gone."* 
      
      This continued for a further 20 minutes. All the marvelous place of Earth where shown, each followed by "it's gone". The air in the summit felt heavy with regret and sadness. 
      
      Finally, the professor gave his small speech. 
      
      "The Universe is ever changing. Threats come and go, planets are born and planets die. I come here today before all of you, to ask that we start a galaxy wide effort to document and store data on all of the natural beauty around us, before its too late"
      
      His speech was met with a standing roar of approval, and the huge effort to document all the natural wonders of the galaxy started immediately after. 
      
      * Build a natural wonder of the Galaxy.
      * must not be man-made, must not be a current location. ( Think outside the box, its an alien universe! Floating islands, poison waterfalls, Erichus volcanoes, theres no limit!)

      This week we will build a chain of supply for food.

      Pick a food item, tier 3 or above, and build a facility to produce that item.

      There is a list of cooked food on the wiki, sortable by tier :

      http://starbounder.org/Food

      It could be a factory, a farm, a fast food place, whatever you deem fit!

      Whilst builds will be judged based on design, as usual, I thought this would be a nice way to show newer players how to get higher tier foods. So if you don't mind taking the time to post in the comments on what you're making, how you're making it &amp; what outside resources ( meat, snow etc ) you would need.


      * Build a food production facility.
      * must take food from raw resources to finished product, contain fridge storage and a shipment solution.

      I don't know where you are in the universe, but today in London, England, United Kingdom, Earth, Solar System, etc etc, it is extremely warm.
      
      The summer is a great time for barbecues, but folks, I dunno. I think today may be too warm even for grilling meats.
      
      What's colder than London? Space, definitely. Let's build a space barbecue! Don't worry about whether you should be able to light a fire without the presence of an atmosphere. It's all fine. Video games.

      [Spookits](http://starbounder.org/Spookit)! They're cute cyclops cat ghosts. But what were they before they were cute cyclops cat ghosts? Just cute cyclops cats, probably. Ghosts don't just appear out of thin ai... oh, right, they do do that. You know what I mean though, right? They were probably alive, once.
      
      So what happened to all the Spookits, and where are they buried? I assume there must be a graveyard, or some sort of appropriately spooky catacomb. Get it? Cat-acomb.
      
      I'll see myself out.

      Volcano-front real estate isn't exactly a "booming" market. 
      
      While most will avoid building in these dangerous areas, it's the perfect place to build a secret base for evil. Good elevation, heating costs are low, no neighbors popping by - it's the type of lair every aspiring villain needs.
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * Build a base on, around, or underneath a volcano! It should feature plenty of [lava](http://starbounder.org/Lava) - as volcanoes do. Since it's an evil base make sure there's at one feature which distinguishes its dastardly nature. ([Here are some Evil tagged objects](http://starbounder.org/Tag:Evil) - but don't feel restricted to these)
      * The base can be on any planet type (or off planet), but [magma](http://starbounder.org/Magma) and [volcanic planets](http://starbounder.org/Volcanic) are especially well suited to the theme this week.

      Earth may be gone, but that doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of eccentric billionaires housed up on planets throughout the galaxy. This week we'll all take a peek inside the lives of some of these ultra-rich weirdos across the universe.

      It's a safe bet that a lot has been lost to floods throughout the course of history. There's a whole vast universe out there -- how many cities and towns and civilizations swept away by rising tides, their inhabitants leaving homes and precious belongings behind in an effort to escape quickly?
      
      Imagine stumbling across the ruins of a drowned city. What would it look like now? What sorts of things would have been left behind? What sort of people lived there?

      There have been rumors of castles in the sky hidden throughout the universe. These structures, hidden by clouds high above the ground are somehow suspended mid-air looking down on the planets below.
      
      How do they stay afloat? Who lives inside? What mysteries do these castles hold? This week we'll hopefully find out more about these elusive structures which are seldom seen by ground-dwellers.
      
      ***

      * **A structure in the sky! Not just tall, but actually not attached to the ground floating-island style.**

      **WHAT'S BUILD OF THE WEEK?**
      
      Each week, we host a contest in which members of the community build something in Starbound relating to a theme.
      
      At the end of the week, members of the community vote on their favorite, we tally up the votes and share the winning post on social media!
      
      Participants can build in Survival or Admin mode, and can use any assets in the game. Mods can be used in moderation, but please don't build your entire structure out of modded items unless the theme calls for that specifically.

      Everyone needs a quiet place where they can relax, get back to nature, and surround themselves with some peaceful plants.
      
      This week we'll explore some of these gardens kept throughout the universe. Tranquil places where food can be grown, trees can be harvested, or just nature enjoyed in an otherwise hostile environment.
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make a peaceful garden.**
      * **It can be indoors (like a greenhouse) or outdoors - as long as there are plants.**
      * **Plants could include crops, trees, or plant-like blocks - as long as it's clear things are growing!**
      
      ***
      
      **BUILDING TIPS**
      
      * The [Starbound Wiki](http://starbounder.org/Starbound_Wiki) is very handy and up-to-date!
      * [This page](http://starbounder.org/Tag) is especially helpful if you're looking for items relating to a specific theme.
      * Type /admin into your chat window to enter /admin mode.
      * Type /help to see a list of admin commands, or [check here](http://starbounder.org/Commands).
      * [This site](https://starbounditems.herokuapp.com/) is useful for looking up item IDs!
      * The [Super Fish Axe](http://starbounder.org/Super_Fishaxe) is useful for clearing lots of blocks quickly (/spawnitem superfishaxe)
      
      * There are a number of [object tags](https://starbounder.org/Tag) which may be helpful with this theme. [Nature](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Nature) and [outdoor](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Outdoor) tagged objects are good, and the [jungle](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Jungle) tag has a number of nature-type objects which can be spawned in using admin commands.
      
      **WHAT'S BUILD OF THE WEEK?**
      
      Each week, we host a contest in which members of the community build something in Starbound relating to a theme.
      
      At the end of the week, members of the community vote on their favorite, we tally up the votes and share the winning post on social media!
      
      Participants can build in Survival or Admin mode, and can use any assets in the game. Mods can be used in moderation, but please don't build your entire structure out of modded items unless the theme calls for that specifically.
      
      Should go without saying, but you may only submit your own work!
      
      The winner is determined by the highest number of votes submitted to the poll which will run on Monday! We may include a few honorable mentions, too. Winners are entered into the [BOTW Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6agpq0/botw_hall_of_fame/).

      Asteroids are a common place to build bases throughout space. They'll often provide voyagers with fuel and supplies while traveling through space.
      
      There are some who chose to remain permanently drifting on asteroids. They've made their home un-tethered from the ground, and some have been able to fashion very cozy homes! This week we'll explore some of these dwellings and see how these lovely homes have been constructed.
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Build a home attached to an asteroid (either in the asteroid layer of a planet's upper atmosphere or in an asteroid field).**
      * **It needs to have a cozy space. It could be connected to a larger base, but there has to be a living space which could be described as 'cozy'. It's not just a fuel station, someone lives here.**

      Wouldn't it be great to leave the hustle and bustle of the universe behind to settle down on a quiet farm.  A peaceful place to work the land, get back to nature, and have some quiet reflection.
      
      This week's theme will take us on a trip out to the country - it's the change of the season so it's a good time to get out and plant your crops!!
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Build a farm! It should have [Crops](https://starbounder.org/Crops) and/or [Animals](https://starbounder.org/Monster#Farm_Animals).**
      * **Keep things rustic/quiet** - the theme is farm life, so don't build a mega-crop processing plant (unless it's adjacent to a farm).
      * Don't feel limited to [farm animals](https://starbounder.org/Monster#Farm_Animals) ([Fluffalo](https://starbounder.org/Fluffalo), [Mooshi](https://starbounder.org/Mooshi), [Chickens](https://starbounder.org/Chicken)) - if you want to use another creature ([monster](https://starbounder.org/Monster#Unique_Monsters), [fish](https://starbounder.org/Fish#Fishing_Collection), or [bug](https://starbounder.org/Bugs#Bugs_Collection)) which is being 'farmed' feel free, but try to keep within the theme.

      Here are a few [object tags](https://starbounder.org/Tag) which may inspire:
      
      * There's a [Farm furniture set](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Farm), and the [Cabin furniture set](https://starbounder.org/Tag:Cabin).

      Let's keep it simple this week - by making a structure that's as 'hi-tech' as possible.
      
      It could be a mobile base, a landed ship, an underground lab - just as long as it looks completely decked out with technology.
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make a 'hi-tech' build, integrating as much futuristic technology as possible.**
      * **There's no restriction on a type of structure, but the theme favors futuristic tech over other available types (steampunk, modern, western, etc).**
      
      ***
      
      **BUILDING TIPS**
      
      * The [Starbound Wiki](https://starbounder.org/Starbound_Wiki) is very handy and up-to-date!
      * [This page](https://starbounder.org/Tag) is especially helpful if you're looking for items relating to a specific theme.
      * Type /admin into your chat window to enter /admin mode.
      * Type /help to see a list of admin commands, or [check here](https://starbounder.org/Commands).
      * [This site](https://starbounditems.herokuapp.com/) is useful for looking up item IDs!
      * The [Super Fish Axe](https://starbounder.org/Super_Fishaxe) is useful for clearing lots of blocks quickly (/spawnitem superfishaxe)
      
      
      **WHAT'S BUILD OF THE WEEK?**
      
      Each week, we host a contest in which members of the community build something in Starbound relating to a theme.
      
      At the end of the week, members of the community vote on their favorite, we tally up the votes and share the winning post on social media!
      
      Participants can build in Survival or Admin mode, and can use any assets in the game. Mods can be used in moderation, but please don't build your entire structure out of modded items unless the theme calls for that specifically.
      
      Should go without saying, but you may only submit your own work!
      
      The winner is determined by the highest number of votes submitted to the poll which will run on Monday! We may include a few honorable mentions, too. Winners are entered into the [BOTW Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6agpq0/botw_hall_of_fame/). The poll will be announced in a comment here and through twitter when it's opened.
      
      Previous themes and entries can be found in the [BOTW Historical Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6dd5tr/build_of_the_week_historical_archive/).

      ***
      Criminal elements throughout the universe have all sorts of hidden dens. These aren't just bases -- they're hideouts, where someone who wants to avoid detection could camp out without anyone noticing.
      
      This week we'll try to uncover some of these secret hideouts. They may be tucked away in a regular looking area, or hidden deep underground. Somewhere the arm of the law may have a hard time reaching...
      
      [Since the next update is centered around hunting criminals down](https://playstarbound.com/18th-september-starbound-vice/), it seems like a perfect time to shake out some of these hideouts and put these criminals on notice.
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make a hideout. A secret room or base which appears hidden from 'normal view' (assume NPCs walking by wouldn't notice).**
      * **It's not only hidden, but it's a place for hiding out**  Cameras/monitors, supplies/canned goods, try to make it feel like a place which isn't only secret, but could be occupied to hide someone as well.
      * It's a criminal hideout, so keep that in mind.
      
      ***

      Last week we ran a [theme suggestion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/770by2/build_of_the_week_suggestion_thread/) which had some really fun ideas. More then one suggestion was for the bridges theme and it sounded exciting! Thanks again for everyone who offered ideas - if you've got more feel free to add them there or into this thread!
      
      So let's see what bridges are out there. There's no restriction on the type, as long as it meets the traditional definition of a bridge (a structure which allows passage over a span).
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make a bridge. It can be alone or as part of a larger structure.**
      * That's it! This week's theme is intentionally a bit vague to leave it open-ended for creativity.

      Those priceless treasures you've seen on display in museums didn't just walk in the door - many were recovered by bold adventurers who risked life and limb to recover them.
      
      There's still treasure to be found throughout the universe! Priceless artifacts which are worth venturing through a temple full of traps to collect. This week the focus is on these dungeons and their monsters, mazes, and/or traps - whatever style of dungeon may have been built to protect a priceless treasure.
      
      Let's go adventuring!
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make a dungeon to protect a treasure.**
      * **It must have a treasure.** Make it clear where the treasure is stored, and make it protected enough so any passerby couldn't just pick it up.
      * The dungeon can be any size, and any style

      Participants can build in Survival or Admin mode, and can use any assets in the game. Mods can be used in moderation, but please don't build your entire structure out of modded items unless the theme calls for that specifically.
      
      Should go without saying, but you may only submit your own work!
      
      The winner is determined by the highest number of votes submitted to the poll which will run on Monday! We may include a few honorable mentions, too. Winners are entered into the [BOTW Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6agpq0/botw_hall_of_fame/). The poll will be announced in a comment here and through twitter when it's opened.

      Towers! Since buildings first started construction, architects have tried to go as high as they can build. Throughout history many have equated a buildings height with it's impressiveness and achievement.
      
      This week we'll explore some of the most amazing towers throughout the universe. Some may be impressive in design, others may just be massively tall. Let's see some of these vertical structures!
      
      ***
      
      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Build a tower.**
      * There's no specific building requirements, but the structure must be more vertical then horizontal to qualify.
      * It could be anything from an ancient temple designed to get as close to the heavens as possible, a radio tower, or even a modern skyscraper. Get creative!
      
      ***
      
      **BUILDING TIPS**
      
      * The [Starbound Wiki](https://starbounder.org/Starbound_Wiki) is very handy and up-to-date!
      * [This page](https://starbounder.org/Tag) is especially helpful if you're looking for items relating to a specific theme.
      * Type /admin into your chat window to enter /admin mode.
      * Type /help to see a list of admin commands, or [check here](https://starbounder.org/Commands).
      * [This site](https://starbounditems.herokuapp.com/) is useful for looking up item IDs!
      * The [Super Fish Axe](https://starbounder.org/Super_Fishaxe) is useful for clearing lots of blocks quickly (/spawnitem superfishaxe)

      This week's theme is Custom Outpost.
      
      The outpost is Starbound's center for gathering supplies and quests. But it may not be the only encampment like this throughout the galaxy!
      
      Create a hub for merchants, questgivers, and adventurers to gather. It doesn't need to look like the Outpost, but thematically it should serve the same purpose.

      **BUILD CRITERIA**
      
      * **Make your own outpost.**
      
      ***
      
      **BUILDING TIPS**
      
      * The [Starbound Wiki](https://starbounder.org/Starbound_Wiki) is very handy and up-to-date!
      * [This page](https://starbounder.org/Tag) is especially helpful if you're looking for items relating to a specific theme.
      * Type /admin into your chat window to enter /admin mode.
      * Type /help to see a list of admin commands, or [check here](https://starbounder.org/Commands).
      * [This site](https://starbounditems.herokuapp.com/) is useful for looking up item IDs!
      * The [Super Fish Axe](https://starbounder.org/Super_Fishaxe) is useful for clearing lots of blocks quickly (/spawnitem superfishaxe)
      
      
      **WHAT'S BUILD OF THE WEEK?**
      
      Each week, we host a contest in which members of the community build something in Starbound relating to a theme.
      
      At the end of the week, members of the community vote on their favorite, we tally up the votes and share the winning post on social media!
      
      Participants can build in Survival or Admin mode, and can use any assets in the game. Mods can be used in moderation, but please don't build your entire structure out of modded items unless the theme calls for that specifically.
      
      Should go without saying, but you may only submit your own work!
      
      The winner is determined by the highest number of votes submitted to the poll which will run on Monday! We may include a few honorable mentions, too. Winners are entered into the [BOTW Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6agpq0/botw_hall_of_fame/). The poll will be announced in a comment here and through twitter when it's opened.
      
      Previous themes and entries can be found in the [BOTW Historical Archive](https://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/6dd5tr/build_of_the_week_historical_archive/).
      
      Thank you to /u/6_lasers for maintaining these archives!

      This is also the last theme we'll have in 2017! We'll do a poll next week for this theme's winner, but won't be doing a new theme until January 9th in the new year.
      
      Big thanks to everyone in the community for another really great year. We really appreciate of how supportive and helpful our community has continued to be for players - both new and old, and we're looking forward to detailing more about future Starbound updates soon!
